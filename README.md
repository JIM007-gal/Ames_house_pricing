# Ames house pricing
## Project description
Prediction model for house prices in Ames, IA.

## Business Intelligence report
The purpose of this study is to identify the most important factors that influence the price of a house in Ames, IA. Taking into consideration this intelligence report, currently undervalued homes on the market could be sold at a profit. This upsell would be the result of having the knowledge to identify cheap Real Estate opportunities as well as the selling know-how.

The dataset studied consists of 2,930 home observations, which are assumed to have been measured within the same time period. Each of these records is characterized with 20 features, ranging from categorical variables, such as neighborhood or lot configuration, to numerical ones, related to rooms dimensions, quality and condition ratings.

Ames is a city with 66,000 inhabitants located north of Des Moines in Iowa. It is known as the home of Iowa State University, where above 36,000 students enrolled. Also, it hosts various important US Department of Agriculture offices, as well as the Iowa Department of Transportation. Therefore, a big portion of the Real Estate market consists of State and Federal personnel, permanent university staff, and researchers. The way these groups perceive value will be reflected in the most and least coveted home features.

After cleaning the data—identifying and inputting missing values—and conducting an exploratory data analysis, diverse statistical learning models were utilized to model reality, yet only the best performer was applied to extract deep subject insight. The variables that were found to have a greater impact were, in hierarchical order:

-	Overall Quality. The rating for the overall material and finish of the house were found to be the most relevant features. The rating goes from 1 to 10—1 being the poorest and 10 being the greatest quality. This measure, however, is abstract and it would certainly be useful to gather more information about the logic followed during the assessment. To learn the amount of investment required to transition from one level to another would be specially interesting, allowing to invest wisely in houses with high upgrade potential. 

-	Ground Living Area. Ames is located in a rural area. Hence, there is a notable difference between Ground Living Area and Lot Area. This feature includes both the first and second floor living areas whose economical value per area is usually greater than that of a field. 

-	Garage Cars. The number of cars the garage can host appears to explain other intrinsic features of the house or even the customer targeted. Thus, a family that owns three cars may have higher purchasing power and spend more in design, whose value is hard to picture.

-	Total basement Area. The size of the basement plays an important role from two points of view. It could serve as storage for medium priced homes and/or a recreational area where to host parties at a customized bar, play pool or videogames. The latter is the case for the more luxurious properties that have enough room to house such amenities.

-	Neighborhoods. In these regards, the quiet residential neighborhoods of Northridge Heights and Northridge—located in the northwest suburbs, are by far the most coveted due to broad spaces between homes that enable magnificent views of the sunset behind the fields. Stone Brook is also more expensive than average because of its access to Ada Hayden Heritage Lake. However, Old Town is one of the neighborhoods that most negatively affects pricing due to its lack of leisure alternatives and its centricity.


Another feature not as significant as the aforementioned yet still interesting enough to pay closer attention is whether there is more than one kitchen above grade. This fact is most likely related to an inefficient interior distribution that led to two kitchens instead of one with a bigger area.

As a consequence, immediate action should be taken to look for houses in Northridge Heights that do not benefit from the astonishing views that the neighborhood enables, carrying out the appropriate reform. Also, the possibility to build a basement that could act as amenity and storage all together would increase profit. Further research should be done, however, on how the studied records were gathered in order to find out what characterizes each overall quality level. Subsequently, under classified materials will be identified and could be upsold as well as houses with the potential for flipping would increase their extrinsic value.
